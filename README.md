In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well

This is the Binary Trees Project for Holberton. In this project we will be Porgramming algorithms in C using the Binary Tree data structure.
